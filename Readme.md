# Effects of trip-level characteristics on autonomous vehicle ownership: a US analysis

## About
Welcome to our autonomous vehicle (AV) ownership project!

We examined how trip-level characteristics may influence autonomous vehicle ownership decisions. Using 639 stated preference survey responses in the US, we developed an integrated choice and latent variable model linking trip- and consumer-level characteristics to AV ownership choices.

If you are interested in autonomous vehicle policies, this project is for you! ðŸ–– ðŸ‘€

## Highlights
* We incorporated trip-level characteristics into AV ownership choice modeling
* We examined elasticities of vehicle ownership market shares
* We simulated future vehicle ownership decisions under three policy scenarios

## Main takeaways
* At the trip level, parking cost, travel cost, and travel time are important predictors for vehicle ownership
* At the consumer level, monthly payment, car ownership importance, and AV safety are significant predictors
* While individual-level characteristics have the most prominent effect on vehicle ownership decisions, trip-level characteristics have a small but measurable effect
* Among trip-level characteristics, parking cost has the largest impact on vehicle ownership decisions, followed by travel cost of ridehailing, and transit travel time. Transit travel cost has almost no effect on vehicle ownership decisions 

## Future directions
* Incorporate more details of the tour structure, land patterns such as urban/rural divide, and attitude change into the model
